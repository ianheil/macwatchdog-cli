## Important Note About macOS Privacy Popups

Some checks (such as Login Items, Accessibility, and Full Disk Access) require your terminal to access system services via AppleScript or direct database queries. On macOS, this may trigger a popup such as:

> "iTerm.app" wants access to control "System Events.app". Allowing control will provide access to documents and data in "System Events.app", and to perform actions within that app.

This is a normal part of macOS's privacy protections (TCC). If you want a full audit, you should click **Allow**. If you click **Don't Allow**, some checks may fail or return incomplete results, but the rest of the tool will still work.

macWatchdog never sends data off your device and is designed to be privacy-first.

## Features
- Audit MDM enrollment, remote access, launch agents/daemons, configuration profiles, USB devices, network interfaces, and more
- Quarantine, restore, or purge unsigned launch agents/daemons
- Detect world-writable/suspicious files, unknown admin users, login items, open network listeners, and apps with Accessibility/Full Disk Access
- Profile/MDM Deep Dive & Management: List, flag, and remove configuration profiles; alert on MDM changes; restore instructions for profiles
- Forensics & Reporting: Export system snapshots, compare snapshots, view a timeline/log of changes, and clear logs/snapshots
- Housekeeping: Easily clear logs, snapshots, and quarantine items from the menu
- Export reports to text or JSON
- Modular, open source, and privacy-first

## Installation

1. **Download the latest release archive** (e.g., `macwatchdog-<version>.zip`). The latest release archive is included in this repository for your convenience.
2. **Run the install script:**

   ```sh
   cd macwatchdog-<version>
   bash install.sh
   ```

   - This will:
     - Unpack the archive to `~/macwatchdog`
     - Create a Python virtual environment in `~/macwatchdog/venv`
     - Install all dependencies into the virtual environment
     - Add a shell alias (`macwatchdog`) to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` for easy access

3. **Restart your terminal** (or run `source ~/.zshrc` or `source ~/.bashrc` as appropriate).

4. **Run macWatchdog from anywhere:**

   ```sh
   macwatchdog
   ```

   This will launch the interactive CLI menu. If you prefer, you can also run the tool directly with:
   ```sh
   python3 ~/macwatchdog/CLI/main.py
   ```

## Uninstallation

To fully remove macWatchdog, its data, and the shell alias:

```sh
cd macwatchdog-<version>
bash uninstall.sh
```

- This will remove the install directory (`~/macwatchdog`), the shell alias, and any logs, quarantine, or snapshot files created by the tool.
- You may want to restart your terminal session after uninstalling.

## Usage

### Interactive Menu

Run the interactive menu (after install):

```sh
macwatchdog
```

You will see a menu with options to run all checks, select specific checks, manage unsigned launch agents/daemons, manage profiles/MDM, use forensics/reporting tools, export reports, view help/about, and view the README.

### Command-Line Options

Run all checks directly:

```sh
macwatchdog check --all
```

Run specific checks (by number):

```sh
macwatchdog check --checks 1,3,5
```

Export the last report from the menu to a text or JSON file.

### Quarantine/Restore/Purge Unsigned Launch Agents/Daemons

Use the menu option to manage unsigned launch agents/daemons. Quarantined files are moved to the `CLI/quarantine` folder and can be restored or purged if needed.

## Maintenance & Housekeeping

- **Clear Timeline/Log:** Use the Forensics & Reporting menu to clear the forensic timeline/log.
- **Clear Snapshots:** Use the Forensics & Reporting menu to delete all saved snapshots.
- **Purge Quarantine:** Use the Manage Unsigned Launch Agents/Daemons menu to permanently delete all quarantined items.

## Help / About

- Access the Help/About menu from the interactive CLI for a summary of features, privacy notes, and usage tips.
- View the README from the menu for full documentation.
- For version info, run:
  ```sh
  macwatchdog version
  ```

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- macOS (tested on recent versions)
- Run with `sudo` for full results (some checks require admin privileges)
